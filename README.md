# ML_MODEL-FOR-Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-
Putting theory into practice! I just completed and submitted my entry for Kaggle's classic 'Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster' competition.

My approach involved:

Exploring the train.csv dataset.

Building a Random Forest classifier.

Training the model to identify patterns related to survival.

Generating predictions for the passengers in test.csv.

It's a foundational step, but crucial for understanding the end-to-end ML workflow on a real-world(ish) problem. Great experience navigating the Kaggle platform!
